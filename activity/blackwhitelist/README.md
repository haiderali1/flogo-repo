# Black White List Utility
This activity allows you to validate a IP address against a Whitelist and/or a Blacklist

IP addresses in the list can be in two formats either a absolute IP or an IP range in CIDR format ie 192.168.1.0/24. Each ip needs to be comma separated

ie:

123.221.142.245,123.257.221.0/24,192.168.1.10

To get the Caller IP you will need to add the X-Forwarded-For header in the RecieveHTTPMessage activity. To do this go to the Output Settings and scroll down to the Headers section. Add a new string header with the name X-Forwarded-For.

Then in the BlackWhiteList Activity assign the ipaddress field from $TriggerData.headers.X-Forwarded-For
